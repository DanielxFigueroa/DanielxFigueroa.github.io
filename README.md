# Web Developer Portfolio
Welcome to Daniel Figueroa's web portfolio repository! This repository serves as a collection of all the development projects that I have created. As a developer, I am passionate about coding and constantly exploring new technologies and tools to build innovative solutions.

# Repository Structure
The repository is organized into multiple folders, each representing a different project that I have worked on. Each project folder contains a README.md file that provides detailed information about the project, including its purpose, technologies used, and installation instructions.
